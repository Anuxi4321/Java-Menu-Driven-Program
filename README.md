# Java-Menu-Driven-Program
The code is a menu driven programs that shows the different operations of Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Searching (Linear Search &amp; Binary Search), Different Sorting Algorithms, Trees and Graph. 


How to code works is that the Menu.java is the main program where all the other program is called when needed. 
It has a case statement inside where when you choose the it, it calls the other program and runs it. Quite simple and easy
to understand. Have a great day! : >

Reason why I did this are:
- Code is cleaner this way
- Easy to locate and fix bugs
- It is organized

Cons for this program are:
- Lots of files
- Quite a hassle to keep all the other files
